A Website Called 'Bondi' Is A Platform to Sell Digital Products Online. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome, normalize.css v8.0.1 and Bootstrap v5.1.3 toolkit. I learned how can i use Bootstrap toolkit with html and css professionally in design the websites.

#### To try the website: 
For work on this website i used Bondi - One Page Creative PSD Template.
