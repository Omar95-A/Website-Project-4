# Website Project 4

> A Website Called `Bondi` Is A Platform to Sell Digital Products Online. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome, normalize.css v8.0.1 and Bootstrap v5.3.1 toolkit. I learned how can i use Bootstrap toolkit with html and css professionally in design the websites.
 
#### To try the website: [Demo](https://omar95-a.github.io/Website-Project-4/).

#### To be clear, the images in this website are of people that do not exist. They are not real, they are from a site that offers images of fake people AI generated. The names are also fake names.

For work on this website I used [Bondi](https://elzerowebschool.github.io/Bootstrap_5_Design_01_Bondi/) - One Page Creative PSD Template.

#### Special Thanks To [Osama Elzero](https://elzero.org/category/courses/html-and-css-practice/).
